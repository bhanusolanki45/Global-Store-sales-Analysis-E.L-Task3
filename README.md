## Global Super-Store Sales Analysis & Strategic Recommendations

## Project Overview
This project uses Power BI to analyze the Global Super-Store Sales dataset. The primary goal was to diagnose profit leakage—understanding **where** and **why** margins are compressed—and to propose actionable initiatives to bolster profitability across regions, product categories, customer segments, and shipping methods.

## Data & Tools
- **Dataset**: Global Super-Store Sales (Orders, Customers, Products, Regions)  
- **Visual Analytics**: Power BI Desktop  
- **Data Prep**: Microsoft Excel (Date tables, DAX measures)

## Key Insights
1. **Aggregate Metrics**  
   - Total Sales: \$12.64 M  
   - Total Profit: \$1.47 M (≈11.6 % margin)  
   - Total Orders & Customers: 51.29 K  
   - Average Shipping Cost: \$26.38

2. **Seasonality Trends**  
   - **Sales Peaks**: November–December (~\$2 M/mo)  
   - **Profit Peaks**: November–December (~\$0.2 M/mo)  
   - **Slower Months**: January–March (~\$1 M–\$1.2 M)
   - 
3. **Product Category Performance**  
   - **Sales by Category**: Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies (each ≈\$4 M)  
   - **Profit by Category**: Technology (\$0.50 M), Office Supplies (\$0.40 M), Furniture (\$0.30 M)  
   - Furniture’s lower profit suggests margin compression via deeper discounting. 

4. **Customer Segmentation**  
   - **Sales**: Consumer (\$6 M), Corporate (\$4 M), Home Office (\$2 M)  
   - **Profit**: Consumer (\$749.24 K, 51 %), Corporate (\$441.21 K, 30 %), Home Office (\$277.01 K, 19 %)  
   - Home Office customers exhibit strong margin per order—ideal for upsells (e.g., consumables, extended warranties). 

5. **Shipping Mode Dynamics**  
   - **Standard Class**: 59.95 % of sales (\$7.58 M)  
   - **Second Class**: 20.29 % (\$2.57 M)  
   - **First Class**: 14.48 % (\$1.83 M)  
   - **Same Day**: Negligible volume  
   - Average shipping cost (\$26.38) highlights opportunity to bundle shipping with high-margin items to preserve profitability.

6. **Regional Profitability**  
   - **Highest Profit**: East (\$0.20 M), West (\$0.20 M)  
   - **Low/Negligible Profit**: Africa, Caribbean, Southeast Asia, EMEA (each near \$0 M)  
   - Indicates that certain regions face high fulfilment costs or aggressive discounting, eroding margins. 

7. **Top Cities & States by Profit**  
   - **Cities**: New York City (~\$70 K), Los Angeles (~\$60 K), Seattle (~\$50 K), etc.  
   - **States**: New York (~\$100 K), California (~\$90 K), England (~\$80 K), New South Wales (~\$60 K), Île-de-France (~\$50 K)  
   - North American urban centers dominate profit, with European and Australian hubs also contributing meaningfully.

8. **High-Margin Sub-Categories**  
   - **Copiers** (~\$200 K profit)  
   - **Phones** (~\$150 K profit)  
   - **Bookcases** (~\$100 K profit)  
   - **Appliances** (~\$80 K profit)  
   - **Chairs** (~\$70 K profit)  
   - These capital-goods and technology items outpace commoditized supplies, making them prime candidates for bundled promotions.

## Problem Addressed
> **Profit Concentration & Margin Erosion:**  
> While total sales are strong (\$12.64 M), profit margins (≈11.6 %) are uneven across regions, categories, and segments. Regions such as Africa, Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and EMEA contribute negligible profit despite sales presence. Furniture matches Technology and Office Supplies in revenue (~\$4 M each) yet trails in profit (\$0.30 M). The challenge is to protect margins while driving growth—identifying where discounting, shipping costs, and product mix are suppressing profitability. 

## Strategic Initiatives
1. **Regional Profit Optimization**  
   - Adjust pricing/surcharges to offset high fulfilment costs in low-profit regions (Africa, Caribbean, Southeast Asia, EMEA).  
   - Replicate successful East/West product bundles (e.g., Canon copiers + service) in underperforming regions to boost average order value. :

2. **Category & Sub-Category Margin Management**  
   - Institute tiered discount caps on low-margin Furniture SKUs to prevent profitability from dipping near zero.  
   - Promote high-margin sub-categories (Copiers, Phones) via value-added bundles (extended warranties, consumables).

3. **Customer Segment Focus**  
   - Launch subscription-based consumables for Home Office segment (printer cartridges, office supplies auto-ship).  
   - Introduce a points-based loyalty program for Consumers to drive repeat purchases during off-peak months.

4. **Shipping & Fulfillment Controls**  
   - Offer “Free Standard Shipping for orders > \$300” to nudge customers away from Second/First Class and preserve margin.  
   - Restrict Same Day to orders > \$1 000 or impose higher surcharges, since it presently yields negligible volume but high cost. 

5. **Seasonal Inventory & Promotion Alignment**  
   - Pre-stock Copiers, Phones, and select Furniture SKUs ahead of November–December to capture peak demand (~\$2 M sales/mo).  
   - Run off-season value-add campaigns (e.g., free accessories) instead of steep discounts, keeping margin intact. 

6. **Geographic Expansion Strategy**  
   - Invest in U.S. urban distribution hubs (New York, Los Angeles) to reduce shipping costs, boosting margins in top-performing metros.  
   - Expand presence in Europe (England, Île-de-France) and Australia (New South Wales) with localized marketing and showroom demos. 

## Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates how targeted, data-driven initiatives can curb profit leakage and accelerate margin growth. By optimizing pricing, discounts, and shipping—and by focusing on high-margin products and segments—stakeholders can achieve balanced, sustainable growth across all markets.
